# about me

I'm a former academic currently working as a software engineer.

I worked as postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Mathematics at Simon Fraser University, in collaboration with Sunnybrook Health Research Centre. I completed my PhD in applied mathematics under the supervision of [Dr. Chris Bauch](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~cbauch/) and [Dr. Madhur Anand](https://ses.uoguelph.ca/people/madhur-anand). My research interests are roughly at the intersection of mathematical ecology, epidemiology and dynamical systems.
I'm also more broadly interested in music, botany, ecology, and open source. 

I do the majority of my research development in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) these days, and vastly prefer working in Julia to other languages for scientific programming.

Code for my publications is hosted at my [UW Gitlab account](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/pjentsch), please see the [research](/cv) section of my website for links to specific repositories.
